SWAPI AngularJS and Custom Directives

This app will allow you to find all Star Wars planets in a dropdown and filter them by the minimum number of residents. It will display an image during loading and another image during error.

When the planet is clicked, you will get information about the planet and all of its residents.

I have used 2 custom directives called swapi-planets and swapi-residents.

Thank you.
